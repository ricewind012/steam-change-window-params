## Settings behavior

After changing settings, you must click the "Restart Steam UI" button if you want the changes to apply immediately.

In advanced mode, if a param has no description, it's unknown what it does. Feel free to document (and show it in the PR) its behavior [here](https://github.com/ricewind012/steam-change-window-params/blob/master/locales/english.json).
