# Change Window Parameters

Modify how Steam displays windows.

Currently may not always work on the main window due to the plugin not starting early enough.

## Settings behavior

If a field has no description, it's unknown what it does.

Dropdowns are currently buggy - if you choose something, the value will become empty but it will actually be set.

## TODO

- Window exceptions
- Preview
